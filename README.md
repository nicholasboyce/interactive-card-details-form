## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about maintaining aspect ratio for designing things like the credit cards here which are not typical CSS/HTML elements.

### Continued development

This was a good exercise in distinguishing when to use Flexbox vs Grid. There was a surprising amount of complexity hidden in this design, and I'm glad I did it. I want to keep practicing styling forms and components like the credit card that can be responsive and maintain their relative sizes and innards.
